Each allowance is represented by the `OCO ERC20 token`. Once verified through [proof-of-personhood](/docs/intro), users can claim their personal carbon allowance, use it directly to offset their own emissions, or trade it freely on open markets. Importantly, the system encourages users to burn OCO tokens equivalent to the amount of CO\u2082 they emit, fostering personal responsibility and active participation in global carbon reduction efforts.\\n\\nTo learn more, check out our [full documentation](/docs/OCO).\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e"},{"id":"introducing-pileum-connect","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introducing-pileum-connect","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-01-introducing-pileum-connect.md","title":"Introducing PileumConnect","description":"PileumConnect is a public OpenID Connect Provider designed for proof of personhood and privacy.","date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"pileum","permalink":"/blog/tags/pileum"},{"inline":true,"label":"franceidentite","permalink":"/blog/tags/franceidentite"},{"inline":true,"label":"oidc","permalink":"/blog/tags/oidc"},{"inline":true,"label":"proof-of-personhood","permalink":"/blog/tags/proof-of-personhood"},{"inline":true,"label":"ethereum","permalink":"/blog/tags/ethereum"},{"inline":true,"label":"eip712","permalink":"/blog/tags/eip-712"}],"readingTime":0.625,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\xe9d\xe9ric","title":"Pileum team","url":"https://fredericb.info","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/frederic"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/frederic.png","key":"fred","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"introducing-pileum-connect","title":"Introducing PileumConnect","authors":"fred","tags":["pileum","franceidentite","oidc","proof-of-personhood","ethereum","eip712"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing O\uff1dC\uff1dO","permalink":"/blog/introducing-oco"}},"content":"[PileumConnect](https://connect.pileum.eu) is a public `OpenID Connect Provider` designed for [proof of personhood](/docs/intro#proof-of-personhood) and privacy.\\n\\n`Users` must own a [french electronic national identity card](/docs/connect) to register an account and prove their identity.\\nThe user\'s identity is processed directly in the browser, ensuring it is never transmitted over the internet.\\n\\nAny `OpenID Connect Relying Party` can use the service to authenticate its users : the only user information provided is a *Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier* (PPID).
